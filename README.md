# Diabetes Risk Factors and At-Risk Population Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to analyze the risk factors associated with diabetes and identify populations that are at a higher risk of developing diabetes. The analysis is performed using machine learning techniques, statistical methods, and data visualization tools to explore and highlight key insights from the dataset.

The main objective of the project is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how different factors like age, gender, lifestyle habits, and medical history contribute to diabetes risk. By leveraging the power of machine learning, this project builds models that can help predict individuals at risk based on these factors.

## Project Description

The **"Diabetes Risk Factors and At-Risk Population Analysis"** project analyzes various demographic, clinical, and lifestyle-related data points to identify factors that increase the likelihood of developing diabetes. The analysis includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of data and correlations between risk factors and diabetes occurrence.
- Machine learning models for predicting at-risk individuals.
- Feature selection to determine which variables contribute the most to diabetes prediction.
- Visualizations that help explain the relationships between different variables and diabetes risk.

The notebook walks through each step of the analysis, including data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset Information

The dataset used for this project includes various attributes like:
- **Age**
- **Gender**
- **BMI (Body Mass Index)**
- **Blood Pressure**
- **Lifestyle Factors** (smoking, physical activity, alcohol consumption)
- **Medical History** (family history of diabetes, pre-existing conditions)
- **Blood Glucose Levels** (fasting, postprandial)
- **Insulin Sensitivity**

This dataset either comes from publicly available health surveys or custom-collected data related to diabetes and metabolic syndrome.

## Requirements

The project is implemented in Python, and the following libraries are required:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow or pytorch (for machine learning models)
- streamlit (if visualization on web app is used)

### Installing the required libraries:
You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow streamlit
```

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fijuwat1032/ML_Project----Diabetes_Risk_Factors_and_At_Risk_Population_Analysis.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd ML_Project----Diabetes_Risk_Factors_and_At_Risk_Population_Analysis
   ```

3. **Install the Dependencies**:
   Make sure to install all required libraries as mentioned above.

4. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Start Jupyter Notebook by running:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open the notebook titled **`Diabetes Risk Factors and At-Risk Population Analysis.ipynb`** to explore the analysis.

## Usage

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: 
   The notebook starts with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) section where the dataset is explored. Missing values are handled, and the data is cleaned and preprocessed.
   
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   New features may be created based on existing data, and relevant features are selected for model building.
   
3. **Model Training**:
   Various machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Neural Networks, are trained to predict diabetes risk based on the input data.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   The models are evaluated using appropriate performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrices and ROC curves are plotted to assess model performance.

5. **Visualization**:
   The results of the analysis are visualized using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to provide insights into the data. Graphs, plots, and charts highlight the most important risk factors.

6. **Prediction**:
   Once the models are trained, you can use the notebook to predict the diabetes risk of new individuals based on the trained models.

## Models and Methodology

The following models were used in the analysis:
- **Logistic Regression**: For binary classification to determine if a person has a risk of diabetes or not.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method that improves predictive performance.
- **Neural Networks**: For advanced prediction using TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Other methodologies include:
- **Cross-validation** to ensure that the models generalize well to unseen data.
- **Feature Importance** analysis to understand which variables contribute most to the prediction.

## Results

The analysis provided insights into the most significant factors contributing to diabetes risk. Some of the key findings include:
- The impact of age and BMI on the likelihood of diabetes.
- The role of family history and pre-existing conditions in diabetes development.
- How lifestyle choices (smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity) affect diabetes risk.

The trained machine learning models achieved high accuracy in predicting at-risk populations, with Random Forest and Neural Networks performing particularly well.

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the application of data science and machine learning in healthcare, specifically in predicting diabetes risk. The results show that predictive models can effectively be used to identify at-risk populations, which could help in early intervention and healthcare management.
